# Age-Eligibility-Checker
Age Eligibility Checker is a simple Python mini project that checks whether a user is eligible based on their age. The program accepts both integer and decimal age values, making it closer to real-life scenarios. It also calculates the approximate waiting time in months for users who are close to becoming eligible.
